# AFK AutoClicker

Can be used to automatically click in any running application without the window needing to be in focus.

## Usage

On startup, the application is added to the system tray. To setup the application, left click on the icon in the system tray.

Change the exe path to path of the executable file (.exe) of the application you wish to send input to. E.g. for MineCraft, set exe path to "Minecraft\runtime\jre-x64\bin\javaw.exe" within your MineCraft installation.

Press OK to save the settings. The settings are saved to a file so they only need to be set once.
Use the hotkeys to start and stop the auto clicker.
